    <p>For years, Minnesota climate and forest scientists have suspected that the state’s tree cover would slowly start creeping northeast as the Earth’s climate warmed; the prairies that predominate in the southwest of the state would take over what was previously a mix of fields and deciduous woods.</p>
    <p>It wouldn’t happen overnight, but it would happen — and the startling thought that Minnesota’s signature forests might be lost altogether was always a worrisome possibility.</p>
    <p>But the technical tools to predict these decades-long changes with any specificity were always tantalizingly out of reach. Until now. That ability came in the form of world-wide climate projection computer models that were developed by scientists at other research institutions around the world, and then adapted to predict local changes to Minnesota’s climate and landscape.</p>
    <p>Their findings were presented at a special series of committee hearings conducted by the Minnesota House of Representatives, with key testimony by Lee Frelich, director of the University of Minnesota Center for Forest Ecology and his associates. The core of their presentation was a set of maps of Minnesota and the Great Lakes region showing the current forest and prairie zones and how they will change and migrate to the northeast as the climate warms and precipitation changes.</p>
    <p>According to Frelich, a key component of climate change is the increased amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the way they retain more and more heat near the earth’s surface. Humans have introduced vast amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere over the last 150 years and continue to do so. Because trees can be extremely sensitive to average temperatures and rainfall, and because Minnesota contains the edges of several &ldquo;biomes,&rdquo; where tree species are especially vulnerable to change, Minnesota’s forest cover could change rapidly over the next century. Oaks that are common in western and southwestern Minnesota are likely to migrate north, while the pines of the &ldquo;boreal&rdquo; forest in northeastern Minnesota are likely to recede north and perhaps disappear from the state entirely.</p>
    <p>The result is nine maps — three scenarios for different CO<sub>2</sub> levels, each with three predictions of the resulting temperatures — each reflecting thousands of variables that have been painstakingly entered into the computer models.</p>
    <p>Ryan Toot, a graduate student in the U’s Natural Resources Science and Management program, said the researchers ran multiple climate models and multiple emission scenarios because &ldquo;the future is uncertain,&rdquo; even under the most sophisticated computer forecasts. From roughly 40 computer models available to scientists today, the U researchers chose three, known as BCC, CCSM4 and Miroc. They capture the range of uncertainty for each of the concentrations of greenhouse gases by choosing cool, average and moderate potential for the region.</p>
    <p>Toot wrote the software that calculated the predicted vegetation from the climate data. The maps have a surprising level of detail, with each square of the maps representing a square kilometer.</p>

    <p>According to Frelich, &ldquo;We knew from (research), that the forest and grassland transition occurs right where the climatic water balance is zero — evaporation and precipitation are equal. Where the balance is negative (more evaporation from soil and plants than precipitation), grasslands occur, and where the balance is positive (precipitation greater then evaporation) forests occur.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Boreal forests, which feature conifers and deep clear lakes, occur where mean summer temperatures fall below a certain threshold, Frelich said. Temperate forest occur where the mean is above that threshold.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;With this information, it was possible to analyze amount of evaporation and precipitation, and mean summer temperature now and in 2070, for each square kilometer,&rdquo; Frelich explained. &ldquo;If summers are projected to be cool enough with positive water balance, then a given grid square would be boreal forest. Where summers are warm with positive water balance, we have temperate forest. A where there is negative water balance, we have prairie, regardless of temperature.&rdquo; </p>
    <p>&ldquo;Summer climates in the future will shift south southwest from 100 to 300 miles, depending on the scenario,&rdquo; said Frelich in an e-mail. &ldquo;So Voyageurs National Park could [become] St. Cloud or northwestern Iowa.&rdquo; </p>
    <p>The climate is likely to change too fast for plant species to migrate to their new locations, Toot said. &ldquo;We’ll probably need to use assisted migration&rdquo; to help plants move to the new locations, successfully replacing the plants and trees that can’t survive the new climate.</p>
    <p>The project is part of an exhibit at the U’s Bell Museum in St. Paul, Weather to Climate: Our Changing World, which runs Feb. 2 to April 28.</p>

      <p> If we make radical reductions: If the world’s rate of greenhouse gas emissions is reduced quickly and significantly, overall carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) levels in the atmosphere will still rise slightly by 2070, reaching 436 ppm. Prairies would advance slightly and Minnesota would lose some or all of its boreal forest. But Lee Frelich, director of the U’s forest ecology center, notes that this scenario would be very difficult to attain because we are already at 408 ppm of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="infoBox ppm515">
      <p> If we make some changes: In this &dlquo;optimistic scenario,&drquo; humanity manages to significantly cut the rate of greenhouse gas emissions, and overall atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels rise to just 515 ppm by 2070. Nonetheless, a prairie ecosystem would encroach on much of the state (depending on how quickly Earth warms), the conifer forest disappears, and much of the state’s eastern half would resemble the mix of grass and oak savanna that covers southwestern Minnesota today.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="infoBox ppm667">
      <p>If we make no changes: Under the &dlquo;business-as-usual&drquo; scenario, greenhouse gases continue to pour into the atmosphere at their current rate, pushing overall atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels to 667 ppm by 2070. If temperatures also rise at the pace of the most pessimistic of the three computer models, most of Minnesota’s northern birch and conifer forests would migrate northward out of the state entirely and much of the state will resemble Kansas today.</p>
