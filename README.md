## Data analysis

Data from ???.

To process the original GeoTiff files, make sure they are in `data/sources` and then run the following:

```sh
./data/lib/process-tifs.sh
```

This will add color, reproject, convert to MBTiles, and upload to Mapbox. Make sure the following is true:

- Environment variable `MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` is set.
- The [Mapbox CLI](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-cli-py) is installed.
